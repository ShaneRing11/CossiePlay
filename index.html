    <h2>Welcome to CossiePlay</h2>
            <p>We here at CossiePlay love costume parties. It’s great fun to get dressed up as your favourite characters and have a great time with friends, maybe even meet some new ones. But we also know how difficult and time consuming making that stunning costume can be.</p>
            <p>That’s where we come in! We don’t think anybody should miss out on the fun of cosplay, so we’re happy to help you get that awesome costume you’ve always wanted, and become the hero (or villain…) you’ve always wanted to be.</p>
            <p>We also host parties on the first Sunday of every month, so whether want to show off that cool new costume we’ve made you or the one that you put together yourself, come along with some friends and have a great time.</p>
        <h2>Announcements</h2>
            <p>We have some cool things happening that we want people to know about</p>
